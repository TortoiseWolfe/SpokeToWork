---

## Phase 7: User Story 5 - Remove Member / Leave Group (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Owner can remove members, any member can leave (except owner without transfer)

**Independent Test**: Owner removes member → removed user loses future access; Non-owner leaves → group continues

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Story 1 (Phase 3)**: Depends on Foundational - MVP delivery point
- **User Story 2 (Phase 4)**: Depends on Foundational, shares components with US1
- **User Story 3-6 (Phases 5-8)**: Depend on Foundational, can proceed in priority order
- **Polish (Phase 9)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **US1 (Create Group)**: Foundation only - can start immediately after Phase 2
- **US2 (Send/Receive)**: Foundation only - can start in parallel with US1
- **US3 (Add Members)**: Uses UI from US1 (CreateGroupModal pattern) - recommended after US1
- **US4 (Upgrade DM)**: Uses addMembers logic from US3 - recommended after US3
- **US5 (Remove/Leave)**: Uses GroupInfoPanel from US6 - can start in parallel
- **US6 (View Info)**: Foundation only - can start in parallel with US1/US2

### Within Each User Story

1. Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
2. Service layer before UI components
3. Core logic before integration
4. Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 1 (Setup)**: All T001-T005 can run in parallel

**Phase 2 (Foundation)**:

- T015 can start in parallel with database tasks
- T006-T014 are mostly sequential (migration file order)

**Phase 3-8 (User Stories)**:

- Test tasks marked [P] within each story can run in parallel
- Component generation tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories CAN be worked on in parallel by different developers

---

## Parallel Example: Phase 3 (User Story 1)

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Write integration test for createGroup() in tests/integration/messaging/group-creation.test.ts"
Task: "Write unit tests for GroupService.createGroup() in tests/unit/services/messaging/group-service.test.ts"

# After tests pass, launch component generation in parallel:
Task: "Create CreateGroupModal component using generator"
Task: "Create useGroupMembers hook in src/hooks/useGroupMembers.ts"
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 + 2 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Create Group)
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (Send/Receive)
5. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test group creation + messaging independently
6. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add US1 (Create Group) → Test → Deploy (Groups exist!)
3. Add US2 (Send/Receive) → Test → Deploy (Groups work!)
4. Add US3 (Add Members) → Test → Deploy (Groups grow!)
5. Add US4-6 → Polish → Full feature complete

### Parallel Team Strategy

With 2+ developers after Foundational:

- Developer A: User Story 1 → User Story 3 → User Story 5
- Developer B: User Story 2 → User Story 4 → User Story 6
- Integrate at checkpoints
